```
my-site/
├─ pages/              every .sinth file in here is a page
│  ├─ index.sinth      → /
│  ├─ about.sinth      → /about
│  ├─ 404.sinth        → 404.html (used by Cloudflare Pages and `sinth preview`)
│  ├─ blog/index.sinth → /blog
│  └─ blog/[slug].sinth → /blog/hello-world, /blog/second-post, ... (dynamic route)
├─ components/         reusable components (any folder name works)
├─ public/             copied to the output root as-is (robots.txt, favicon.ico, ...)
├─ assets/             copied to dist/assets/
├─ sinth.config.json   optional configuration
└─ package.json
```

Rules:

- Every `.sinth` file in `pages/` is a page. No keyword or boilerplate is needed.
- Files and folders whose names start with `_` are not pages (use them for drafts and page-local components: `pages/_partials/Hero.sinth`).
- A file in `pages/` that only declares components or functions (no markup, no metadata) is treated as a module, so older projects keep working.
- If there is no `pages/` folder, every `.sinth` file in the project root that contains markup or metadata is a page; `components/`, `lib/`, `styles/`, `assets/` and `public/` are skipped.
- File and folder names in `[brackets]` are [dynamic routes](/docs/getting-started/pages-and-components#dynamic-routes).
